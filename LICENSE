Amp is in a bit of limbo as it directs where its license will go. We want the code to fall under
the Ruby license.  However, we didn't think about that before we looked at the Mercurial source code.
Mercurial (as noted below) is GPLv2+, and thus any code we derived from its codebase is also GPLv2. Any
code which then interacts with, links against, calls, etc. that derived code is also considered GPLv2.

So: each file is marked with a *standalone license*. If that code were to be extracted and treated as
one unit, it would be under the license it is marked under. Almost all files will be marked as the
Ruby license, but some quite substantial portions will be marked as a derived work and is thus GPLv2.

Our goal is to find developers to clean-room those GPLv2 parts and re-license them as the Ruby license.
Until then, Amp as a project and distributed as one unit is licensed GPLv2.

This project includes a large amount of source code from a number of different resources.
They are listed, in no particular order, along with the license ascribed to the code
associated with it.

1. Mercurial (GPLv2)
	A large number of algorithms in Amp are inspired by, or in some cases, direct translations,
	of code in the Mercurial source. This makes this that code a derivative work, and thus GPLv2.
2. BZ2 (Ruby License) - Guy Decoux 
	This code has been copied verbatim into our repository.
	
	11/27/2009 - Michael Edgar added Ruby 1.9+ compatibility. This involved adding conditional compilation
				 due to changes in Ruby (MRI)'s C API.
	
	"This extension module is copyrighted free software by Guy Decoux

    You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the same term as
    Ruby." -- README.rdoc of BZ2 gem

3. Priority Queue - 2005 Brian Schroder
	This code has been copied verbatim into our repository.

6. Difflib - this library from Python's standard library has been directly ported to Ruby.
   It falls under the PSF license, which allows redistribution under a license of our choice. We
   choose to redistribute it under the Ruby License.

7. HighLine - this library provides some cross-platform terminal methods. The license is included below.
