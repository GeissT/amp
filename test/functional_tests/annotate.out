medgar 2:  The Amp Commandments Redux:
 adgar 0:      1. Thou shalt not useth the "for...in" syntax.
 adgar 0:      2. Thou shalt useth only but 80 columns, for those who useth the lord's
medgar 2:         editors, vim and emacs. (emacs sucks - oh no he didn't)
 adgar 0:      3. Thou shalt preface thine variables with _ only when thou needest,
medgar 2:         lest ye face judgement for this most grave sin. (this isn't python.
medgar 2:         no __method__ is necessary!)
medgar 2:      4. Thine variables should have descriptive names, for thine ruby might
 adgar 0:         read like the psalms.
 adgar 0:      5. Thine variables, longer than 6 letters and composed of two or more
 adgar 0:         words, shall separate those words with the lord's underscore, so thine
 adgar 0:         code shall flow like the Nile herself.
 adgar 0:      6. Thou shalt rake thine yard frequently, to be sure thine code is
 adgar 0:         well-documented for thine neighbors.
 adgar 0:      7. Thou shalt use alias_method over alias or I shall goeth Chris Brown
medgar 2:         all over thou. (meh we don't need threats in the commandments.)
 adgar 0:      8. Thou shalt use parentheses in thine defintions of methods, for the
medgar 2:         consistency of the codes in this repository.
 adgar 0:      9. Thine comments shall start, when above thine method definitions, with
 adgar 0:         2 (two) hashes, and the information, then, beginning on the line below
 adgar 0:         it. Thou shalt leave one blank comment line between thine comment info
 adgar 0:         and thine yard information.
medgar 2:      10. Thou shalt make great and grand use of the yard extension. It is
medgar 2:         pretty sweet.
seydar 3:      11. Name thine motherfrakking vari
seydar 3:  
seydar 3:  
seydar 3:  VERSION 3
seydar 3:  
seydar 3:  VERSION 3
seydar 3:  ables motherfrakking descriptively.
